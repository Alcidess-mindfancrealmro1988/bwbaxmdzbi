Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Opus and, I gotta say, I’m kind of all over the place right now. I mean, what even was that ending? Like, for real? One second it’s all deep and philosophical, and then BAM—mind blown. I swear, if I knew it would mess with my brain this much, I might’ve needed more popcorn. 777 But hey, at least it wasn’t predictable, right?

Honestly, I don’t even know why I didn't just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   earlier. Would’ve saved me from all that awkwardness at the theater when my seat kept squeaking every time I moved—good times, let me tell ya. But seriously, what’s with the director’s obsession with all that weird, artsy stuff? It’s like, reduce the angst, man! Just a tiny bit!

Oh, and speaking of angst, there's this one scene that was SO intense, I almost forgot to breathe. You know what I mean, those scenes where you just kinda lose yourself in the moment without even realizing? Yeah, it was epic. Maybe I should drag someone with me and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, to pick up what I missed while I was busy gasping in awe. Guess I’ll have to see who’s 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 this weekend to be my unwilling victim—um, I mean, company. Lol.

int infinity = 1000000; // what even is this for anyway?

So yeah, you should totally check it out if you've got the time. Even though I'm tired from all the mental gymnastics it put me through. Why do we love things that confound us, huh? It's like a love-hate relationship, except with less yelling and more popcorn!
